PropertiesFu - row attributes
=============================

PropertiesFu is a plugin which provides functionality that mixes features of
STI and Polymorphic Associations. It allows to define attributes for an AR class
which are stored in a separate table (kind of dictionary key -> value), but are
accessible as easily as the regular AR attributes.
Thanks to this approach it is possible to create an inheritance model with
various attributes (properties) without storing them as columns in one big table
(STI) or in many smaller tables (polymorphic associations).

Example
=======

Here is a small example from test file:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    properties_fu :user_properties, :street, :city
    validates_presence_of :street

    def address
      "#{city}, #{street}"
    end

    # dumb example - it shows that it is possible to change values of properties easily
    def upcase_city!
      self.city = city.upcase
    end
  end

User is the AR model, which has two properties (attrs) - street, and city. These
properties are stored in the table called user_properties (the first parameter of
properties_fu class method).
As it is shown in the example it is possible to read and write properties
as the regular AR attributes. Changed properties are automatically saved on
after_save hook. Also, when object is destroyed its properties are destroyed too.
Properties can be validated by default Rails validation methods.

It is possible to define many properties tables for one model.

How to use
==========

In order to use this plugin there need to be created a table. For the above example
there should be created the following table:

  create_table "user_properties", :force => true do |t|
    t.column 'resource_id', :integer    # don't forget about this!
    t.column 'name', :string
    t.column 'value', :string
  end

Next in a model there has to be used properties_fu method with the following
parameters:
  properties_fu :properties_table, :property1, :property2, ..., :propertyN

How to build queries using properties?
--------------------------------------

It is possible to create a SQL query with properties. In order to do this there
has to be defined special :joins statement. It can be created by the following method:
properties_table_joins(:property_1, :property_2, ..., :property_N)
where arguments are names of properties used in the query. If property argument
is not one of defined properties (in properties_fu method), it is ignored.
Properties_table_joins method returns a string so there is no problem to combine
it with other join statements used in the query. After adding such :joins statement
there can be used property_1.value, property_2.value, etc. in the query conditions.
Example usage:

User.find(:all,
          :joins => User.user_properties_joins(:city, :state),
          :conditions => ['city.value = ? AND state.value = ?', 'New York', 'NY'])


That's all! Enjoy!
